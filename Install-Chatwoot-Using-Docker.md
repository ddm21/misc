# Chatwoot Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Chatwoot locally using Docker on your Windows machine.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the latest version of Docker and Docker Compose installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Setup Steps

Follow these steps to deploy Chatwoot:

1. **Download Required Files**

   Open your command line interface (CLI) and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/develop/.env.example
   curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/develop/docker-compose.production.yaml
   ```

2. **Edit the Environment Variables**

   Open the `.env` file to configure Redis and PostgreSQL passwords:

   ```bash
   notepad .env
   ```

3. **Edit Docker Compose File**

   Ensure the passwords in the `docker-compose.yaml` file match those in the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   notepad docker-compose.yaml
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**

   Prepare the database by running the migrations:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm rails bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare
   ```

5. **Start the Services**

   Get the Chatwoot service up and running:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **Verify Installation (Optional)**

   To check if the installation is successful, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -I localhost:3000/api
   ```

   Alternatively, open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is running before executing the commands.
- For security and best practices, consider configuring a reverse proxy, such as Nginx, to handle connections to your Chatwoot instance.
